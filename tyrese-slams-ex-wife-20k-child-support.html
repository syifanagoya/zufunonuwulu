Like, who spends that kind of money on a kid? [My daughter] was one when [Samantha] took my baby from me.</p><p>“We never spent $20,000 a month on our child and the credit card was wide open, so what the fuck do you suddenly need that kind of money for?”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>In a lengthy caption attached to the social media video, the <a class=underline-link href=#>TGT</a> vocalist went into detail about how he’s made several attempts at pushing back against the legal proceedings that he is convicted have been biased against him thus far.</p><p>Check it out below:</p><p><a class=underline-link href=#>Tyrese is currently requesting a new judge in his ongoing divorce case</a>, suggesting that the one currently presiding over it is prejudiced against him. According to a TMZ report last week, he filed a motion in court alleging Judge Kevin M. Farmer abruptly canceled a hearing that would have allowed him to tell his side of the story before having to fork over a $450,000 bond.</p><p>Instead, he was ordered to come up with the six-figure sum in just 10 days. His plan was to use the hearing to explain why he couldn’t pay the money because of the <a class=underline-link href=#>Hollywood strikes</a>.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/10/tyrese-ex-wife-takes-accountability-for-ugly-and-messy-divorce-250x142.jpg alt="Tyrese’s Ex-Wife Takes ‘Accountability’ For ‘Ugly & Messy’ Divorce" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Tyrese’s Ex-Wife Takes ‘Accountability’ For ‘Ugly & Messy’ Divorce</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>October 30, 2023</p></a><p>This isn’t the first time the Fast & Furious actor has taken issue with Judge Farmer. Days before a court hearing earlier this year (the results of which he was trying to appeal with this latest court date), <a class=underline-link href=#>he blasted the judge for being “racist” and accused him of calling his ex-wife a “bitch”</a> in the private chambers of his office. He also accused the judge of illegally sealing the case to cover up his own misconduct.</p><p>“We tried to get him recused, we tried to get him thrown off the bench because of his conduct and his unprofessionalism. And then there were a bunch of things pertaining to the outcome of my case that he did that was literally illegal,” Tyrese said in an Instagram post.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Tyrese and Farmer’s issues date back to last August, when <a class=underline-link href=#>the Fulton County jurist threatened to hold him in contempt of court</a> for arguing with his ex-wife’s lawyer over his earnings. At that hearing, the Transformers&nbsp;star was ordered to pay over $10,000 a month in child support.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mirsqqVqLJuv8uapKxlla16uLXFnmRraJtisKm1y51krK2gpbyzwA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
