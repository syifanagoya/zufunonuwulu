His film career took off in 2009, but he continued to thrive after appearing in the independent film Buried in 2010.</p><p>In 2011, he made a stunning return to the big screen. Then, in 2012, he demonstrated his comedic talents in The Change-Up. In 2013, he also provided voice work for the animated films The Croods and Turbo. He appeared in indie films such as The Voices in 2014.</p><p>In 2015, he appeared in the thriller Self/Less and had a small role in the film Woman in Gold.
