He somehow managed to call him up and sneak around and make me a ring!"</p><p>How are wedding plans going?</p><p>"I bought a lot of magazines and am cutting out pictures," she told <a href=#>UsMagazine.com</a>. "I have a folder and I cut out pictures and glue them in. It’s in kind of a binder thing."</p><p>She said she isn't sure who she wants to design her dress, but will probably go with "someone I’ve worked with before that I know I can work well with."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She said she wants something "pretty traditional, maybe with flowers on it — not like real flowers!"</p><p>Though she is envisioning a small wedding, "I don't see that happening," the singer said. "There are so many people. He has a huge family; they’re all really close. My family is big, but we're not that tight-knit. His is about three times the size of mine."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasnZVirm66xLBkqaCfqbxuu8Vmmpqqop6ybsHNnZyrr5%2BksW601KCcZp2enK6oscyepa1lop67qHmRaWhpb2Fk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
