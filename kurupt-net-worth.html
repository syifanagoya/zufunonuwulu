He is a famous rapper, singer and actor mostly known under his stage name Kurupt, He is a member of the rap group “The Dog Pound” and, for about three years, between 2002 and 2005, he was the Vice President of Death Row Records, a known record company. He is also part of the hip hop group “The HRSMN” (The Horsemen), a group consisting of four platinum and gold selling artists: <a href=#>Canibus</a>, Killah Priest, Ras Kass and Kurupt.</p><p>So just how rich is Kurupt? In 2015, his net worth is estimated at $1 million, mainly obtained from music, the television industry and personal appearances. Numbers revealed through the media show that his wealth has doubled in the last few years, as Kurupt’s net worth in 2011 was estimated at $500,000. His music seems to have been bringing him about $150,000 a year, his earnings being completed mostly with movie appearances and endorsements. His sponsorship income has been evaluated at between $35-$52,000 a year. In 2014 Kurupt’s personal medicine line of marijuana, called “Moon Rocks” was launched. For this occasion, the singer released a mixtape with the same name, which has brought him an estimated income of $300,000.</p><h3>Kurupt Net Worth $1 Million</h3><p>Kurupt lived in Pennsylvania with his mother and sisters until he was 16, when he moved to California to start his music career. At the beginning of the ’90s, he signed with Death Row Records, the company where many known rappers had contracts: Lady of Rage, <a href=#>Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href=#>Nate Dogg</a>, RBX, and <a href=#>Dr. Dre</a>. Kurupt appeared on <a href=#>Dr. Dre’s</a> album “The Chronic”, on <a href=#>Snoop Dogg’s</a> album “Doggystyle” and he launched the album “Dogg Food”, together with <a href=#>Daz</a>, his group partner in “The Dog Pound”. “Dogg Food” is one of his best albums up to date, with more than four million copies sold. All these ventures brought added income to Karupt’s net worth. As a rapper, he was a part of what the press called the “East Coast West Coast war”, a hip hop rivalry disputed between 1991 and 1997.</p><p>A close friend of <a href=#>Tupac</a>, Kurupt left the record company when <a href=#>Tupac</a> was murdered and, in 1997, released his first solo album, called “Kuruption!”. Until now the rapper has launched six studio albums, nine collaboration albums, and four compilation albums, the sales of which are considered to be the main source for Kurupt’s wealth. In 1996, he was nominated for a Grammy award for the song called “What Would You Do”.</p><p>As an actor, Kurupt has appearances in several movies, including “Murder Was the Case” (1995), “The Wash” (2001), “Hollywood Homicide” (2003), “Brothers in Arms” (2005), and “The Penthouse” (2010). He has also appeared in many television series and specials, such as “GGN: <a href=#>Snoop Dogg’s</a> Double G News Network” (in 2013 and 2015), “<a href=#>Tupac Shakur</a>: Thug Angel 2” (2011), “Celebrity Rap Superstar” (2007), and “Monk” (2007). His acting career and TV performances have brought Kurupt at least $300,000 towards his net worth.</p><p>In his personal life, Kurupt had a four year long relationship with the model and actress <a href=#>Foxy Brown</a> between 1996 and 2000. He was then married to Natina Reed, also a singer, between 2001 and 2003, and together they had a son. Since 2007, he has been married to Gail Gotti, also a rapper.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=28.502131287298><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Kurupt</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 23, 1972</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Singer, Rapper, Businessperson</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Natina Reed (m. 2001–2003)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Tren Brown</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Parents</td><td>Jomax Collins, Sharon Hill Brown, C-Walk, Who Ride Wit Us, We Can Freak It</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Roscoe</td></tr><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Gail Gotti</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Nicknames</td><td>Kurrupt , Ricardo Brown , Ricardo Emmanuel Brown , Young Gotstra , Kurupt Young Gotti , Kurupt Tha Kingpin , Young Gotti</td></tr><tr readability=0.36363636363636><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/sanholobeats</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/kurupt_gotti</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.39130434782609><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/sanholobeats</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/thepenagon</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0476097</a></td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Music Groups</td><td>Tha Dogg Pound, The Hrsmn, Soul Assassins, Dungeon Family, C-Walk, Who Ride Wit Us, We Can Freak It</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Song</td></tr><tr readability=21><td>Movies</td><td>Half Past Dead 2, Half Past Dead, Hollywood Homicide, Dark Blue, The Wash, The Penthouse, I Accidentally Domed Your Son, Vice, Brothers in Arms, A Talent for Trouble, Vegas Vampires, Bigg Snoop Dogg: Adventures of Tha Blue Carpet Treatment, Cut Off, Don of All Dons, Kurupt: G-TV, Kurupt: Uncut, Dogg...</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=6.5810397553517><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=1.9756097560976><td>1</td><td>Member of the rap group, <a href=#>Tha Dogg Pound</a>.</td></tr><tr readability=2.2307692307692><td>2</td><td>He's a close friend of <a href=#>Marion 'Suge' Knight</a>, the C.E.O. of Death Row Records.</td></tr><tr readability=5.7647058823529><td>3</td><td>Wrote and produced the song, "Streets on Fire", with <a href=#>Porno For Pyros</a> for the film, <a href=#>Dark Blue</a> (2002), which was never released on album.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>4</td><td>He is an expert of the so-called C-Walk dance, a Crip Gang ritual.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack readability=35><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>The Worst of Pirated Adult Swim Shows</td><td>2016</td><td>TV Movie performer: "The Next Episode San Holo Remix"</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Straight Outta Compton</td><td>2015</td><td>writer: "What Would U Do" - as Ricardo Brown</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Modern Drug</td><td>2015</td><td>Short performer: "The Next Episode"</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Entourage</td><td>2015</td><td>writer: "What Would U Do?" - as Ricardo Brown</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Rude Tube</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Series performer - 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Grand Theft Auto V</td><td>2013</td><td>Video Game performer: "The Next Episode", "C-Walk" / writer: "What Would U Do" - as Ricardo Brown</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Something from Nothing: The Art of Rap</td><td>2012</td><td>Documentary writer: "Ride On Caught Up" - as Ricardo Brown</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Filthy Frank Show</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Series short writer - 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Entourage</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Series writer - 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Vice</td><td>2008</td><td>performer: "Scrape Thru Tha Hood" / writer: "Scrape Thru Tha Hood" - as Ricardo Brown</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Dead Tone</td><td>2007</td><td>performer: "Let's Get High" / writer: "Let's Get High" - as Ricardo Brown</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Be Cool</td><td>2005</td><td>performer: "G's & Soldiers" / writer: "G's & Soldiers" - as R.
