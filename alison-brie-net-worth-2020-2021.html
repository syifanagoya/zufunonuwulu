Her father, Charles Terry Schermerhorn, was a musician and entertainment reporter while her mother, Joanne Brenner, was a worker in an NGO. She had the Christian father and Jewish mother, but it didn’t affect her upbringing. Her parents even separated after a few years of her birth, but they equally gave love and care to Alison.</p><p>Alison was passionate to become an actress since her childhood, so she also joined the Jewish Community Centre along with her school and started performing in the stage theatres.

She made her first appearance on the big screen in 2006 with the TV show ‘Hannah Montana’. Though she appeared only in a few episodes, she grabbed many eyeballs.</p><p>Her actual career began after 2007 when she bagged lead roles in two TV series simultaneously.
