Most years, it was <strong>Kane Brown</strong> sharing MC duties, with <strong>Anthony Mackie</strong> joining the pair in 2022.</p><p>The 2024 Country Music Television Awards will air live on CBS from the Moody Center in Austin, Texas on Sunday, April 7, at 8 p.m. ET. The CMT Awards will also stream live on Paramount+.</p><p>Ballerini stole the spotlight last year at country music’s fan-voted award show. First, she made <a href=#>her red carpet debut</a> with boyfriend <strong>Chase Stokes</strong>, and then she shined a light on issues close to her heart. Ballerini opened the show with an emotional tribute to victims of the <a href=#>Nashville school shooting</a> that took place days earlier.</p><p>“I wanted to personally stand up here and share this moment, because on August 21 2008, I watched Ryan McDonald, my 15-year-old classmate at Central High School, lose his life to a gun in our cafeteria,” she shared during the 2023 broadcast. “Tonight’s broadcast is dedicated to the ever-growing list of families, friends, survivors, witnesses and responders whose lives continue to forever be changed by gun violence. I pray, deeply, that the closeness and the community we feel for the next few hours through of music can soon turn into action — like real action — that moves us forward together to create change for the safety of our kids and our loved ones.”</p><p>Later in the broadcast, she took the stage to perform “If You Go Down (I’m Goin’ Down Too)” <a href=#>with drag queens</a> <strong>Kennedy Davenport</strong>, <strong>Manila Luzon</strong>, <strong>Jan Sport</strong> and <strong>Olivia Lux</strong>. The performance came weeks after Tennessee Senate Bill 3 (a.k.a Tennessee drag ban), which banned “adult cabaret performance” in front of children, was signed by the governor.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The singer is known for her raw honesty. Her Grammy-nominated breakup album, Rolling Up the Welcome Mat (For Good), chronicled her moving on after her 2022 <a href=#>divorce from <strong>Morgan Evans</strong></a>. However, she <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> that the album evolved into something that was more universal when fans started latching onto improvisations she made during live performances.</p><p>“It’s not mine anymore, it’s just not. Like, it’s very much so an ‘ours’ thing. And so [the fans have] been very vocal from the very beginning — as soon as I played <a href=#>‘Blindsided’ on SNL</a>, they were like, ‘We need the ‘Yeah, Sure, OK’ version,’” she told Us in August 2023. “And then when I started singing ‘Penthouse’ live, it kind of just changed and evolved every night. And then one day, on a whim, I <a href=#>just changed one word</a> and it took on a whole new life and they were like, ‘We need that version.’ It’s called ‘The Healed Version.’ I never made that up! That was them.”</p><p>The CMT Awards nominees will be announced in March.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKepKOarm6uwKWjnqqZo7Zuw8ilo2agn6jBbn6Pa2tmm52peqLDwKubrGWnnsGpu9StZJplk6S1sL%2FTaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
