All MTN bundles are worth familiarizing oneself with, but their WhatsApp, International, and Voice Bundles are some of the most important because almost everyone makes calls, and also the social media platform, WhatsApp, has become increasingly popular with several young people (including the elderly) using it for their daily communication with friends and family.</p><p>Every network user would always complain about what their network provider is not doing and how they don’t feel satisfied. But it is rare to see them leave to find ‘greener pastures’ elsewhere, maybe because they are other things they enjoy from the service provider that they know they may not find with other network providers. That been said, there is another side to this. It is also possible the users fall short of familiarizing themselves with all the packages and services provided by their network providers and therefore shortchange themselves in terms of enjoying all the services available.</p><p>So, if you want to know all there is about MTN WhatsApp, international and voice bundles, you are at the right place; keep reading.</p><h2><strong>Everything You Need To Know About MTN WhatsApp Bundles</strong></h2><p>MTN WhatsApp bundles are <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>data deals</a> that users can use only to chat with friends, download short videos, voice notes, and view their contact status updates on WhatsApp. These bundles cannot be used to surf the internet or on any other social media platforms. This is because MTN has also provided bundles for social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Tik Tok.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/mtn-whatsapp.jpg alt="MTN WhatsApp bundles" width=700 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Although each WhatsApp bundle has an expected duration, what you do with it will determine how long it would last – whether it will reach its earmarked expiry date or whether it will be exhausted before then. For instance, chatting does not consume as much data as downloading a file or viewing people’s status updates.</p><p>So, if you purchase a one-week WhatsApp data bundle, and you mostly use it to download files and view status, it is certain that your bundle will not last up to its validity (one week). Also, MTN WhatsApp bundles can be used to make calls with friends on the platform.</p><h3><strong>MTN WhatsApp Bundles</strong></h3><p>Now you know what to expect from MTN WhatsApp bundles, here are the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>different bundles</a> you can choose from.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Cost</strong></td><td><strong>Data bundle</strong></td><td><strong>Duration</strong></td></tr><tr><td>R2</td><td>50MB</td><td>1 day</td></tr><tr><td>R5</td><td>100MB</td><td>3 days</td></tr><tr><td>R10</td><td>250MB</td><td>7 days</td></tr><tr><td>R30</td><td>1GB</td><td>20 days</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If you always use WhatsApp, you should go for the 1GB plan, which has a validity period of 20 days. It may be more expensive, but it has the highest data offer and will save you the stress of buying a data deal too often.</p><p>Going for cheaper data deals may seem economical at first, but you will realize that you are spending more going for the cheaper options over a long period of time. The daily and weekly plan is best if you do not frequently use the social media platform but need it for a while.</p><p>However, you should develop an affinity for WhatsApp as an MTN user because the telecommunication giant has several self-services that could be carried out through and with the chatting app, such as buying recharge cards and checking your airtime and data balances, among other things.</p><h3><strong>How To Buy WhatsApp Bundles On MTN</strong></h3><p>Buying the MTN WhatsApp bundle is a straightforward process. This is only because MTN has provided two different ways to suit different users’ preferences.</p><h4><strong>You Can Buy MTN WhatsApp Bundles Using USSD Code</strong></h4><p>The use of USSD codes remains one of the easiest, fastest, and most reliable methods for buying airtime, data, and checking balance. To use USSD code to buy MTN WhatsApp bundle, follow the steps below:</p><ul><li>Open the browser on your phone.</li><li>Dial <strong>*136#</strong>.</li><li>Follow the prompts to select the data bundle you are interested in.</li><li>Proceed to pay.</li></ul><p><strong>How To Opt Out Of MTN WhatsApp Bundles</strong></p><p>Just like buying WhatsApp bundles, opting out is also easy. It is important to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>opt out</a> of the service if you do not intend to pay for it again.</p><ul><li>Dial <strong>*141*5#</strong>.</li><li>A list of all the bundles you are currently subscribed to.</li><li>Select <strong>WhatsApp</strong>.</li><li>You will receive an SMS to notify you that you have unsubscribed.</li></ul><h4><strong>You Can Also Buy MTN WhatsApp Bundles Using The MTN App</strong></h4><p>While USSD code does not require data, using the MTN app to perform any service will require you to have little data on your phone. To access the app, you will have to first download it from the Google play store or app store for Android and iPhone users, respectively, then install and register your number. After that, you can navigate through the app to purchase a WhatsApp Bundle.</p><h3><strong>Other Social Media Bundles You Should Also Consider</strong></h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/Rapists-Using-Social-Media-Platforms-To-Lure-Victims-SAPS-Warns.jpg alt width=696 height=387 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>To eliminate the limitation of staying on just one social media platform, MTN has also made provision for data bundles on other social media platforms. So if you really cannot warm up to WhatsApp, here are other social media bundles you can subscribe to. Note that all other social media bundles can also be purchased by dialing <strong>*136#</strong> or via the MTN app.</p><h4><strong>Twitter Bundles</strong></h4><p>Like MTN WhatsApp data bundles, Twitter data bundles can only be used on Twitter; and they are also very affordable.

Note that when you share to other platforms that YouTube data bundles do not cover, you will need a data plan covering that platform for sharing to be successful. Here are the different data deals you can get on the MTN YouTube bundle:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Cost</strong></td><td><strong>Data Deal</strong></td><td><strong>Duration</strong></td></tr><tr><td>R5</td><td>100MB</td><td>1 day</td></tr><tr><td>R20</td><td>500MB</td><td>1 week</td></tr><tr><td>R50</td><td>1GB</td><td>1 month</td></tr></tbody></table><h4><strong>Tik Tok Bundles</strong></h4><p>Tik Tok is also another social media platform that has an MTN data bundle.
