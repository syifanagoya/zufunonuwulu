NXT will be at the LC Pavilion in Columbus this Saturday, June 13th at 7:30 p.m.</p><p>Bliss talks about breaking into wrestling, her original asprirations, who she models her career after, and more. You can read a few excerpts below:&nbsp;</p><p>When I first started performing in the ring, my main goal at the time was to be the Disney Diva—the person that could be a role model to young girls that they can look up to, that they can relate to, that they would want to dress like. We’re a PG company. We’re role models. We’re strong, empowering women. I’m sure there’s a little girl out there that’s prancing around in a tutu somewhere—I can show her she can be tough as well.</p><p>It was because I felt like I was kind of at home. [Wrestling] was something that me and my family always got together and bonded over, so when the opportunity came, I was like, ‘That’s what I should be doing.’ If any other opportunity like acting comes along, that’s great, but as soon as I saw this opportunity, I was like, ‘That’s what I’m meant to do.’ All of my cheerleading and gymnastics and bodybuilding and training prep have prepared me for what I truly believe in my heart was this.</p><p>Trish Stratus&nbsp;for sure. I really liked watching her. Me and my family loved the Hardyz and Lita. I tried to have a little bit of snappiness to my moves like&nbsp;Lita&nbsp;did, but mostly, I really liked watching Rey and how he moved because of his size. I knew if I ever wanted to do this, I was probably not going to be the tallest gal or the biggest one in the ring. I really looked up to Trish because she was also a smaller framed girl. I believe my size actually helps me because I like to go for the element of surprise [Laughs] where people don’t expect much of me because of my size and stature. I like to shock people as well with the over-the-top personality.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwgZdva2prXZa5psTAZpmloaOoerWty6SqZqaoqXqjscinnmaZXZm2tLrEsmSdoaaWeri0zmabopxdqLWmecyom56kXZ2ys3nCmqmenaJirqfAxKs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
