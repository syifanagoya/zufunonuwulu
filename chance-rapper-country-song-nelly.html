I would do it if I could do it with who I consider to be the most important country star of our time, the incomparable Nelly,” Chance said. “He’s an amazing artist. I remember I used to listen to — I mean he made ‘Hot In Herre,’ which, to me is naturally a country song.”</p><p>Chance then began singing Tim McGraw and Nelly’s 2004 smash hit, “Over and Over,” while explaining his sentiments further.&nbsp;“He’s got some country classics. Nelly’s a legend,” he said.</p><p></p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Chance discussed the <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Black Star Line festival</a> which he and <a href=# rel=noopener>Vic Mensa</a> created and how 52,000 people showed up for the celebration in Accra, Ghana in January.</p><p>“It was the largest country in the history of Ghana,” Chance said. “It was way deeper than trying to do a festival. It was an opportunity for like — for Black people around the world to get together and commune safely and like, have some good music. It was a free concert.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Chance and Mensa are looking to host the event in Kingston, Jamaica in 2024.&nbsp; Special guests for this year’s festival included <a href=# rel=noopener>Dave Chappelle</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Erykah Badu</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>T-Pain</a>, <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Talib Kweli</a>, and others.</p><p>He also performed his new single <a href=# rel=noopener>“YAH Know”</a> which features a slowed-down sample of Whitney Houston’s iconic 1985 track, “How Will I Know.”</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/02/chance-the-rapper-and-questlove-upset-with-hbo-axing-south-side-250x142.png alt="Chance The Rapper & Questlove Aren’t Happy About HBO Axing ‘South Side’ Sitcom" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Chance The Rapper & Questlove Aren’t Happy About HBO Axing ‘South Side’ Sitcom</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>February 23, 2023</p></a></span></p><p>In January, Chance The Rapper sat down with <a href=# rel=noopener>Rolling Stone</a>and <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>responded to criticism the festival received</a>, particularly regarding <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Dave Chappelle</a>&nbsp;and Talib Kweli’s involvement, and other issues currently plaguing Ghana.</p><p>“That was something that was on my mind from the jump when we made it,” Chance said. “I always wanted this festival to be something that, for one, provided access to people that don’t typically get to go to these concerts because a lot of the events around that time do price people out.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>He continued: “The goal overall is to just create community. I think that within this trip. I think a lot of the people that came from the diaspora, most of the people, if not all of them, were very respectful of the space and a lot of relationships were built, a lot of people created substantial relationships and connections that I think will live long after this festival. I think it’s something that we just have to remain in conversation about. I think it’s important that those issues are raised, and those conversations are had.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0miaoZmemLJuvsCpp56qXZi8trrTq7Bmq5%2BjtG66xKWjsg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
