Martinez said if given the opportunity, her and Gangrel could have made a lot of money together. She references an event done in Germany and on the trip over, she and Gangrel started off on the right note, but matters just didn’t end up happening in the grand scheme of the squared circle for the two:</p><p>“Gangrel and I could have made a lot of money together, but that didn’t happen because of whatever the issue is…I actually did a show with him in Germany.&nbsp; Half of the trip, everything was fine to where I brought things up to him and he really confided in me…he and I had such a cool conversation.&nbsp; I felt like I understood him more, I felt like perhaps he understood me more, and I really thought we were getting somewhere there.&nbsp; Then, the second half of the trip wasn’t so good and I’m not sure why that went that way…I’m not going to get into the details because I’m not trying to be gossipy.</p><p>“It was so weird; I’m friends with the Germany people and to this day we joke about it because it was so unnecessary and weird, and I don’t understand it.&nbsp; However, it’s fine…Gangrel has every right to dislike me – and maybe it’s not even a dislike, maybe I just rub him wrong.&nbsp; That’s fine, that happens in life; I’m fine with it.&nbsp; But it did break my vampire heart here and there, because that Germany trip I really thought I connected with him…We could have made so much money and he wouldn’t have had to take but one bump!”</p><p>(Transcription credit should go to VOC Nation)</p><p>You can listen to the entire conversation</p><p>airs every Tuesday at 6pm ET / 3pm PT on the VOC Nation Radio Network.
