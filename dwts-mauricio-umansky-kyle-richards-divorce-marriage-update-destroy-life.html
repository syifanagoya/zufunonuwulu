The realtor and Dancing with the Stars contestant made headlines earlier this year when it was reported that he and Kyle had separated after 26 years of marriage. But the couple, who've starred on the show since its season one premiere in 2010, are trying to work things out, Mauricio said in a new interview.</p><p id=eMiLHxoMQkS data-wc=55>"We were dealing with our own things, kind of, super quietly and internally, just our own issues," Mauricio, 53, said <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>on a recent episode of The Agency's Red Mic</a> podcast. "I mean, certainly, we're not separated. We're not divorced at this point. We are not any of that stuff. We're still dealing with our marriage."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/41a094209d08-mauricio-umansky-family-vacation.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0e2dff95d9c5-kyle-richards-missing-wedding-ring-explained-2.jpg><p id=enaEXAFExR7 data-wc=91>As RHOBH fans know, Mauricio and the Halloween Ends actress, 54, share daughters Alexia, 27, Sophia, 23, and Portia, 15, as well Farrah, 34, Kyle's child from a previous marriage. &nbsp;"It's been an amazing 26 years and it's been a difficult one year," said Mauricio, who made his DWTS debut this past Tuesday with his pro dancing partner Emma Slater. "Kyle and I are blessed, where we actually had 26 years that we did not have a bad year, and I know most marriages have bad months, bad weeks, bad years."</p><p id=er1c8x0CKOp data-wc=50>Back in July, the couple made a joint statement refuting reports of a divorce but acknowledging challenges. "Any claims regarding us divorcing are untrue," they said. "However, yes, we have had a rough year. The most challenging one of our marriage. But we both love and respect each other tremendously."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Real Housewives star Kyle Richards has an eye-watering net worth, but there's one caveat" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/539283c6907e-gettyimages-1401221698.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Real Housewives star Kyle Richards has an eye-watering net worth, but there's one caveat" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Real Housewives star Kyle Richards has an eye-watering net worth, but there's one caveat</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Real Housewives star Kyle Richards explains missing wedding ring amid divorce rumors" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c15b5bc019f4-kyle-richards-missing-wedding-ring-explained.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Real Housewives star Kyle Richards explains missing wedding ring amid divorce rumors" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Real Housewives star Kyle Richards explains missing wedding ring amid divorce rumors</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=evEt1ZpnkbF data-wc=49>"There has been no wrongdoing on anyone's part," it then continued.
