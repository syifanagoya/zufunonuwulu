When the Plaintiff applied for the first loan, Mr. Abai introduced me to Engineer Makori, whom I coincidentally already knew,”</strong> Makori adds.</p><p>He says in his statement that Engineer Makori affirmed his commercial interest in New Mega Limited and was the one that facilitated the contract they had with Mombasa Cement.</p><p>He observes that Mr. Abai sent the offer letter for the first loan of Ksh 6 million to Engineer Makori to review and approve.</p><p>His admission that they were sharing and doing background checks for information on mutual customers can be interpreted to mean the two had shared sensitive information about Abai’s account and New Mega Africa in general.</p><p>He adds in statement number 20 that when New Mega Africa defaulted on their facilities, he undertook an independent background check on payments from Mombasa Cement.</p><p><strong>“I first called Engineer Makori to inquire whether there was a delay in payments from Mombasa Cement, which he promised to revert to me after checking with them.”</strong></p><p>Absa ordered to pay a couple Sh234 million for fraudulent shares sale: On Tuesday, January 10, 2023, the bank was ordered to compensate a couple more than Sh234 million over the fraudulent sale of their shares.</p><p>The bank was found guilty of fraudulently selling the couple’s shares in various companies, including East African Breweries Plc (EABL) and BAT Kenya.</p><p>This was after a valuation report showed that as per the Nairobi Securities Exchange data, the market value of the couple’s shares by then was Sh231,188,156.</p><p>The court also awarded the couple interest and costs of the suit.</p><p>In deciding how to value the couple’s shares, Justice Alfred Mabeya said the expectation of the plaintiffs when buying the shares was to benefit from the shares and the goodies, including dividends, bonuses, and interest that accompanied owning shares.</p><p><strong>“The value given to shares is not only in the number of shares alone, but the whole intrinsic value carried by that one share. When the plaintiff came to court to seek justice for their shares, they did not only look at recovering the actual number of shares lost but those shares together with all the benefits that had been lost,”</strong> said the judge.</p><p>The fraudulent sale of the shares was again a scheme orchestrated by senior staff, some of whom are still working at the bank.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Makori-Witness-Statement-1.jpg alt width=872 height=1600 sizes="(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Makori-Witness-Statement-2.jpg alt width=869 height=1600 sizes="(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Makori-Witness-Statement-3.jpg alt width=879 height=1600 sizes="(max-width: 879px) 100vw, 879px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Makori-Witness-Statement-4.jpg alt width=900 height=1600 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Makori-Witness-Statement-4.5-1.jpg alt width=888 height=1600 sizes="(max-width: 888px) 100vw, 888px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><span id=Theft_of_Sh717111>Theft of Sh717,111</span></h2><p>In what could also escalate suspected collusion between the bank’s staff and third parties, a man accused of stealing Sh717,111 from an Absa Bank account held by Aknotela Limited was charged before Milimani Chief Magistrate’s Court in August 2023.</p><p>The withdrawals by Simon Kipngetich Tonui happened on various dates between August 7 and September 15, 2023.</p><p>He is facing 12 counts of stealing, contrary to the law, even as Aknotela Limited remains suspicious of the bank’s staff having colluded with Simon.</p><p>The charge sheet presented on Monday, August 7, 2023, links Tonui to theft of an Absa Bank Kenya limited visa Business Debit Card valued at Sh460, belonging to one Esther Akoth Kokeyo, alias Akothee.</p><p>He is then suspected to have stolen from the bank’s account registered under a company linked to Kokeyo thereafter.</p><p>In the charges outlined, in count two, Tonui is accused of stealing Sh264,000 from an Absa Bank account registered under Aknotela Limited by way of withdrawing the amount by ATM within Nairobi on various dates between August 7 and September 13.</p><p>Counts three and four allege that the accused, on August 8 and 9, withdrew Sh44,000 and on August 31 he withdrew Sh40,000 from the aforementioned account.</p><p>Akothee is also accusing some senior Absa Nyali branch staff, including the branch manager, of colluding with external fraudsters.</p><p>Absa disclosed spending Sh1 billion on court settlements in the financial year that ended on December 31, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnq6urMHNnaBnm5%2BifKKu0ppkm5meoHqssc2ymGatnqKutLfEnWSipl2otXJ8jKagpaSZpLtussCknGafpZa%2ForrTnpxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
