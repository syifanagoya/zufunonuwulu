It starts with the manufacturing process when the shirt is made. According to Dr. Karen Iveson, a researcher, and developer at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Dropps</a>, woven fibers are subjected to stress, so they’re easier to cut into the final garment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“When the garment is subjected to heat, the stress that the fibers are under is lowered,” Iveson explains. This causes the fibers to spring back to their desired state, decreasing the fabric’s surface area. As a result, any type of heat will alleviate the stress forces that the fibers are under and shrink the garment, she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-fabric-type-matters></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Fabric Type Matters</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once you know how much heat a piece of fabric can handle, altering tops to fit your style preferences becomes a piece of cake. However, it’s worth noting that different fabrics, weaves, and fabric quality all play a role in how much a fabric shrinks and whether or not it gets distorted, Lee W. Johnson, founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Old Bull Lee</a> tells InStyle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For example, high-quality cotton can shrink anywhere from five to seven percent, whereas lower-quality cotton will shrink seven to 10 percent, notes Johnson. Additionally, materials shrink by percentage, and because shirts are typically longer than they are wider, it's to be assumed that a shirt will shrink more in length than width, Johnson adds.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-shrink-clothing></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Shrink Clothing</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Christian Vierig/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The only surefire way to shrink your clothes is to use heat in some way, shape, or form. Running them through the washer and dryer is a popular method, but it’s not the only one, so we reached out to an expert for their most creative tips. Ahead, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Priya Raj</a>, a fashion expert, breaks down how to shrink a shirt by fabric.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Denim, Polyester, and Cotton</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re hoping to shrink a fabric from this trio, the key is to wash it on the longest, hottest setting of your machine, says Raj. Then, once your shirt is finished washing, pop it into your dryer ASAP on the highest setting. The trick, Raj tells us, is not to allow the shirt to cool down. “Keep checking on the garment and remove once you’re happy with the size — remove and air dry.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Cashmere and Wool</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Skip the washing machine method if you’re looking to shrink a shirt made of cashmere or wool. Instead, Raj suggests taking a spray bottle and evenly spritzing the front of the garment down using about two ounces of water.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Fold [the garment] on itself so that the wet sides are together, and press down,” Raj instructs. “Repeat on the backside of the garment, then turn it inside out and do the same. Now put it in the dryer for 20 minutes on high heat then on low heat for 20 minutes. This will get it down by about a full dress size.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But, be warned: DIY shrinking can slightly distort the texture of cashmere and wool, so you should look and consider if it’s worth hiring a professional tailor to make adjustments instead, Raj stresses.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Linen and Silk</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The process of shrinking <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>linen</a> and silk is arguably the easiest labor-wise. All you have to do is soak the shirt in warm — not hot — water for a few hours, stirring the water every so often, then dry it on low heat. “This is the best method to shrink without damaging, as these are two quite delicate fabrics,” says Raj.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ask the Experts</a>: Where our favorite fashion know-it-alls share their wisdom.
